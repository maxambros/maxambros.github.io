00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:08.069
in this first short video I want to give
an overview of the ePTW system so I'm

2
00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.389
gonna show the permit to work workflow
which is basically the same as on the

3
00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.580
paper version as well as how I use that
accounts work so this picture shows the

4
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.039
permit to work workflow which once again
is the same as the paper workflow so as

5
00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.579
the subcontractor you are at the three
first steps of our workflow

6
00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.840
The application is created by the
subcontractor applicant then he sends it

7
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.500
to the subcontractor EHS who assesses
the application and then to the

8
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.289
subcontractor PM for approval once the
subcon PM approves the permit goes to

9
00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.850
the M+W task supervisor for
assessment once they approve it goes to

10
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.010
the M+W Assessor they approve it
goes to the M+W approver for the

11
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.789
final approval
so once the M+W approver approves

12
00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.100
the permit the permit is approved and
the applicant is informed about that

13
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.869
along the workflow everybody can also
send the permit back to the applicant

14
00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.830
at any time after a permit is approved
we have a daily endorsement so every day

15
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.250
the applicant needs to attach documents
like your JSA like the daily checklists

16
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.070
our permits our weekly permits so they
typically start on the Monday and on a

17
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.729
Sunday we ask you to apply it by
Wednesday for next week's Monday start

18
00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:43.110
date if there's any urgent work so for
instance on the Tuesday suddenly a crane

19
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.990
is coming in in the afternoon where you
need a permit then you apply same way

20
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.880
permit will last from Tuesday to Sunday
so we always end on a Sunday even if you

21
00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.840
start on Friday the N tape will be the
Sunday so in the general case your

22
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.180
permit running from Monday to Sunday you
do your daily endorsement every day then

23
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.289
on Sunday once you finish work or your
permit expires

24
00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.800
you need to close that permit after you
close the

25
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.120
as the applicant he will send it
automatically to the M+W task

26
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.270
supervisor who will then assess and
finally close off the permit the biggest

27
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.800
difference to the paper system that you
might know is that we have no more

28
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.620
parent permit in the electronic system a

29
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.220
short note on user accounts so as a
subcontractor

30
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.750
we give you three accounts which are
share the cards so we have one applicant

31
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.210
account where all your applicants log in
to the same account in the application

32
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.860
they will state the name same for your
EHS as one EHS account for your company

33
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.370
all the EHS staff can log into that
account and even for the PM's if you

34
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.900
have multiple all of them use the same
shared accounts so that's for the

35
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.800
subcontractor for M + W on the other
hand we have individualized accounts so

36
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.250
each task supervisor, each Assessor (M+WEHS) and each M+W project

37
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.250
manager has his or her own account
